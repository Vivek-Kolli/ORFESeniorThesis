Although clearly not in the same stratosphere as the 6-8 Doncic, Merrill did show that same type of clutch gene as a primary shot creator against both SDSU and New Mexico, never getting rattled or sped up, playing at his own pace and drilling a handful of off-the-dribble 3s from well beyond NBA distance. While not the most creative live-dribble passer, he's more than capable of running the show for stretches, seeing over the top of the defense and making the right read, especially with teams having to fight over ball screens because of his shooting.\\nWith short arms, an undefined frame and less than stellar run-and-jump athleticism, Merrill will still have some skeptics in NBA circles. He has had some trouble containing more explosive perimeter players over his career, he doesn't always turn the corner against long athletes, he's not the most reliable finisher in traffic, and it remains to be seen whether an NBA team would give him the same type of on-ball freedom he receives at Utah State. He'll also already be 25 by draft night. For reference, since 2000, only two players age 25 or older have been drafted -- Florida State's Bernard James and Auburn's Mamadou Ndiaye.\\n\",\n",

Will be one of the most explosive athletes in the NBA right away, but is also blessed with incredible fluidity, coordination, body control and power. Does unprecedented things seemingly every game that inspire sheer astonishment.\\n\\nExtremely skilled and instinctive. Will be very difficult for opposing defenders to slow down due to his ability to create offense with the ball in his hands. Absolutely lethal in transition, but also a very dangerous option in the half court. Excellent ball handler who changes speeds effortlessly and gets incredibly low to the ground with his array of moves. Uses polished footwork and generates amazing force en route to finishing around the rim and drawing fouls. Also a strong passer thanks to his extremely high basketball IQ. Can also score in the post, blowing past traditional big men and overpowering smaller players with his huge frame. Much improved shooter as well.\\n\\nAppears to have ideal NBA superstar personality. Outstanding teammate and competitor. Unselfish. Loves to do the little things needed to help win games. Deflects all of the attention he receives back toward the team. Brings frenetic energy defensively when locked in, showing the ability to guard positions 1-5. Won't turn 19 until July.\\nImprovement areas\\n\\nDifficult to project given his unique game. Some NBA scouts struggle with the fact that they can't find anyone to compare him to, which is part of the evaluation process. Doesn't have a traditional position in yesterday's NBA, but in the modern game will likely become a team's primary creator offensively. Will need a creative coach and the right personnel around him to unlock his full potential. Needs to be surrounded by shooting to be most effective, perhaps similar to Ben Simmons in that regard.\\n\\nJust an average shooter. Made only 24 3-pointers in 33 games at Duke, as well as 64 percent of his free throw attempts. Mechanics leave a lot to be desired. Ball comes off the side of his hand. Not very fluid in his lower body getting into his jumper.\\n\\nCan he stay healthy playing the same wrecking-ball style over the course of 82 games? Will likely need to learn to dial back the intensity at times. Had some minor knee issues in high school and has a body type that can get thick quickly if he's not careful. Will be the second-heaviest player in the NBA right off the bat, despite his height.\\nFull scouting report\"]"

Preston has some of the best basketball instincts of any player in this class and is capable of making every read a point guard needs operating out of pick-and-roll. With the dearth of true point guards this size, Preston is likely a more consistent jumper away from carving out a niche in the NBA as he brings several winning intangibles to the table that teams covet with his unselfishness and overall basketball instincts. -- Jonathan Givony\""
